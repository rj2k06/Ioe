This project is a Smart Irrigation System based on the Arduino Uno, designed to optimize water usage efficiently. 
A soil moisture sensor is embedded in the soil to continuously monitor moisture levels, transmitting real-time data to the Arduino Uno for analysis.
The system operates autonomously based on the sensor readings:
When soil moisture is high, a seven-segment display shows the message "HIGH", and the water pump remains switched off to prevent overwatering.
When soil moisture is low, the display shows "LOW", and the water pump is activated to ensure adequate irrigation.
Additionally, the precise moisture level readings are displayed on a connected device, providing real-time monitoring and control.
This system enhances water efficiency, reduces manual intervention, and promotes sustainable irrigation practices.
